# Contributing
If you want to add something big contribute to `brokefetch_beta.sh`
If spot a bug, I suggest fixing it in all three (`brokefetch.sh`, `brokefetch_beta.sh`, `brokefetch_mod.sh`)

# The golden opensource rule

# also don't forget
this projet uses da [MIT](https://github.com/aserdevyt/brokefetch/blob/moded/LICENSE) license which is kinda stupid in my opinion 
but anyways , what MIT license means is you can do EVERYTHING you want with this project with "0" restictions, so yea ðŸ˜” do whatever you want.
