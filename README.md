## What is this?

`brokefetch` is the only system info tool that doesn't pretend your life is okay.

Inspired by `neofetch`, but with:
- Sadness
- Regret
- A CRT monitor

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Szerwigi1410/brokefetch
cd brokefetch
chmod +x brokefetch.sh
./brokefetch.sh
```
### using install.sh
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Szerwigi1410/brokefetch
cd brokefetch
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```
### or use the installer "OS-wide"(experemental)

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Szerwigi1410/brokefetch/refs/heads/main/install.sh > install.sh ; chmod +x install.sh ; bash -c "./install.sh" ; rm -f install.sh
```

### AUR (yes it's back)
```bash
yay -S brokefetch-git
```

### ~AUR mod~ not any more 😭

```bash
yay -S brokefetch-mod
```

### pacman

install aserdev's repo

```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aserdevyt/aserdev-repo/refs/heads/main/install.sh)
```

install brokefetch

```bash
sudo pacman -Sy brokefetch
```

### Homebrew
```bash
brew tap T1mohtml/brokefetch
brew install brokefetch
```

### Nix Flake
```flake.nix```
```
{
  ...
  inputs = {
    # rest of the inputs

    brokefetch.url = "github:Szerwigi1410/brokefetch";    
  };

  outputs =
    {
      # other outputs
      ...
    }@inputs:
    {
      # implement modules here
    }
}
```

```configuration.nix```
```
{
  # rest of inputs (eg: pkgs, config, lib)
  inputs,
  ...
}

{
  # your configuration

  environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
    # rest of the packages
    inputs.brokefetch.packages.x86_64-linux.brokefetch # or replace brokefetch package with brokefetch-beta
  ];

  # rest of configuration
}
```
---
# Important note!

- `brokefetch.sh` - Stable, "just works"
- `brokefetch_beta.sh` - Might contain bugs, has the newest features
- `brokefetch_beta2.sh` - just a backup
- `brokefetch_EDGE_legacy.sh` - just a backup of the old edge version (currently not present)
- `brokefetch_mod.sh` - a version of EDGE that loads the logos from ~/.config/brokefetch/logos (mod stands for **mod**ular). Currently supports 485 ascii logos!

(brokefetch_EDGE got renamed to brokefetch_beta)

---
# Troubleshooting
If you have any issues with brokefetch, try to remove the config and run brokefetch again.
